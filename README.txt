This is Corey Thomason's A* Search Algorithm program to solve the 8 Puzzle Problem.

To Run:
1) go to directory that contains .java files
2) javac EightPuzzle.java
3) java EightPuzzle


To use Program:

You have the choice to randomly generate an 8 puzzle problem, to enter your own 8 puzzle problem, 
or (for my own purposes) to generate 100 test cases and see the data. 

When it prompts you, simply enter the integer assigned to the choice on the menu.
If you want to randomly generate puzzles, it asks you how many you want to generate, and if you want to see
all the steps from initial to goal state. The program does not count the puzzles that are impossible to solve, 
but it shows the puzzles anyway. 

If you want to input your own puzzle, enter the puzzle in array form.
For example: 2 3 5 1 4 6 0 7 8


Have fun!
